Consider using the 1-N-N&#178; rule &ndash; that is, if labor is worth K, then capital is worth 1/N &#215; K, and ideas are worth 1/N&#178; &#215; K, for some "scaling factor" N that you agree on. The rationale is that we want labor, capital and ideas to be equally valuable when aggregated over all projects. Since labor is the least portable while ideas are the most portable, this rule models the fluidity of these categories as, roughly, "for every project you directly work on, N projects will use your work, and N&#178; projects will be inspired by it." Note, nevertheless, that the ideas analysis described elsewhere in this document is not in terms of "inspiration" (implying causation) but only similarity.</p><h4><a name="(part._7_.Deanonymize_and_.Tally)"></a>7 Deanonymize and Tally</h4><ol><li><p>"Deanonymize" &#8211; connect each leaf node in the appraised labor tree to a single contributor in the original non-anonymous list prepared by core project contributors.</p></li><li><p>Repeat (1) for capital.</p></li><li><p>Sum up the proportions by leaf nodes across all appraisal trees, weighted by the scaling factor for each tree (i.e. in the manner decided upon in "reconcile the appraisals"), to arrive at the final attributive proportions that total to 100%.
